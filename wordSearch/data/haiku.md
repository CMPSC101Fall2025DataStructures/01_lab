# Haiku

There once was mouse who lived in house
who told all around,
"If you all come to my house,
I will have cheese given all around!"

Cheesy dreams at night
Gouda thoughts and brie desires
Feta my fears away

In the land of pizza
Queen Pepperoni wears a crown
To the saucy kings delight

Moonlight serenade
Basil's gentle whisper calls
Love in every bite
